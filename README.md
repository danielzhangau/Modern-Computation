## Lab1: Code Breaking
The Caesar cipher is a simple plain text substitution cipher, where you replace your message alphabets to the same alphabet but shifted by a constant offset.

## Lab2: Turing Machine Simulator
In this laboratory, we will create Turing machines based on a Python simulator and program them using transition rules. The Python Turing machine simulator runs with a single sided infinite tape designed using Python generators. We will also be able to print the configuration of the machine during computation to debug and implement the algorithms requested in the following parts of the laboratory.
The [Busy Beaver game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_Beaver_game) is creating a halting, binary alphabet Turing machine that writes the greatest number of ones on its tape using a limited number of states (or cards) plus an accept or halt state. Each card usually represents a state and its transitions based on the alphabet character encountered.
